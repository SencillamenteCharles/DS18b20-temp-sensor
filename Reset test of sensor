/*
nitialization Procedure—Reset And
Presence Pulses
All communication with the DS18B20 begins with an initialization
sequence that consists of a reset pulse from the
master followed by a presence pulse from the DS18B20.
This is illustrated in Figure 15. When the DS18B20 sends
the presence pulse in response to the reset, it is indicating
to the master that it is on the bus and ready to operate.
During the initialization sequence the bus master transmits
(TX) the reset pulse by pulling the 1-Wire bus low
for a minimum of 480µs. The bus master then releases
the bus and goes into receive mode (RX). When the bus
is released, the 5kΩ pullup resistor pulls the 1-Wire bus
high. When the DS18B20 detects this rising edge, it waits
15µs to 60µs and then transmits a presence pulse by pulling
the 1-Wire bus low for 60µs to 240µs.
